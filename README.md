Objective
For this project, I want to explore user review data from TripAdvisor and use clustering techniques to group users based on their preferences for different types of destinations. My goal is to build a recommendation function that determines whether one user's favorite destinations would be a good fit for another user based on their cluster.

conclusion
For User 8 check if User 8 and User 28 belong to the same cluster. If they do, it implies they have similar preferences according to the clustering algorithm. If they are in the same cluster, we recommend destinations linked by User 28 to User 8. Otherwise, we do not recommend. For User 11: compare User 11 with User 16 and User 28. The recommendation function compares the clusters to determine similarity in preferences between two users. If they belong to the same cluster, it suggests that they have similar preferences, hence it is better to suggest destinations liked by one user to the other. Otherwise, it is not recommended.
